# OopAssignment1

For the given assignment i tried to create a GUI inspired from Iron Man movie.

I read a table of elements from a .csv file which i use later to find the health status and  to increase the need 
of any elements for the machine/robot to be in optimal state.

Also i included a search part where the scaners and radars are searching for any enemies.
